# Snake
This is for the "snake" game, based on Luchang's AI program.

## Structure
`Battle` class contains the game board and two players, it coordinates the moves of each player and displays the board (on real time hopefully).

## Tasks
- [] Add `Player` class, which represents the AI program. It should be able to interact with the Luchang's AI bots, using std `fork()` and `pipe()` etc. to communicate.
- [] Add `Battle` class to coordinate the players' moves and store them.
- [] Using openGL to display the board
- [] Display the game in realtime
- [] Add mouse and/or keyboard interaction.
